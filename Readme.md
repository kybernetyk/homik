#Homik - ncurses server monitor
So this is essentially my "let's learn ncurses" project. When (if) this project is finished it's intended to be a server monitor like pingdom or uptimerobot. Only local and in your tmux ;)

Of course not intended for mission critical stuff. But useful to track local machines, etc. (And running stuff in your terminal gives you extra hacker cred of course).

Currently it's barely a prototype...
